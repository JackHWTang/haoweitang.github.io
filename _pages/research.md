* __Monetary policy surprises: robust dynamic direct and total causal effects__ (with Lynda Khalaf. Job Market Paper) 
	* __Abstract__: In this paper, we study the dynamic causal effects of a monetary policy shock on the US economy within the
Local Projection - Instrumental Variable [LP-IV] framework. Our reassessment is motivated
by the emerging concerns in the literature about popular IVs that are based on high-frequency
identification. We approach related difficulties as follows. First we provide weak-instruments
robust inference on the traditional LP-IV coefficient which we denote as the direct causal effect
[DCE]. Second, we define, estimate and test an alternative response parameter, denoted
as the total causal effect [TCE], that accounts for the inherent unobservable endogeneity factor resulting from the first stage regression error. The TCE is identified whether the
considered IVs are weak or strong. Our view is that both effects play an important role in
capturing the net impact of a policy shock. In the context of two baseline empirical models
with factor controls, results confirm that conventional 2SLS methods produce statistically
insignificant responses at conventional levels. Using identification-robust approaches produces
economically more plausible results, yet overall, we find that instruments are weakly
informative on DCEs. Estimates of the TCEs provide critical insights which, in sharp contrast
to DCE estimates, are mostly unchanged as additional credit spreads are considered.
We find that outcomes can go in the opposite direction from what theory would predict
on credit markets and the macroeconomy, which suggests that DCEs may miss important
responses.

* __Revisiting the Flow View of Quantitative Easing: Evidence from Asset Purchases__ (with Hashmat Khan)
	* __Abstract__: In this paper, we
examine the flow view of quantitative easing (QE) using monthly data on Federal Reserveâ€™s
pre-announced asset purchases from the second and third rounds of QE. We determine
both average and cumulative purchasing effects using structural VAR and local projection
methods, respectively. For financial assets, we find that the purchasing shock increases the
stock price index and the 10-year treasury yield, but it decreases the housing price index. For
macro aggregates, there is no statistically significant average effects of the purchasing shock,
however, we find that the accumulation of the purchases does increase both the industrial
production and the consumer price index.

* __Basel Liquidity Regulation and Bank Lending in the U.S.__ (with Lynda Khalaf)
	* __Abstract__: In this paper, we examine
the impact of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on bank lending in the U.S, using a
Difference-in-Difference framework with a variety of identification methods. We are particularly
interested in treatment effect dynamics. In this context, the dynamic two-way fixed
effect (TWFE) model is commonly used which consists in including dynamic indicators for
time relative to treatment which allows for treatment adoption to vary across time. The coefficients
on these indicators aim to track the evolution of treatment effects. However, recent
econometric works suggest that TWFE estimators do not recover the hypothesized causal
effect; severe bias cannot be ruled out even when treatment effect dynamics are homogeneous
and in the absence of anticipatory behaviour. The underlying reasons for such failures can
be summarized as follows: (i) parallel trend assumptions (PTAs) - some of which may often
be implausible - with varying strengths lead to different interpretable causal effects; (ii) the
interpretable causal effect is in fact an (unknown) linear combination (weighted average)
of the indicator coefficients, (iii) the role of conditioning covariates and treatment anticipation.
Available evidence on the LCR ratio is scarce and is restricted to standard event
studies. In this paper, we compare standard dynamic TWFE estimates to recently proposed
alternative specifications that allow us to introduce various group-time aggregation schemes.
Results underscore the importance of defining clear interpretable parameters, allowing for
conditioning on covariates. In general, we find no effects of the LCR on bank lending, and
the assumptions embedded in the TWFE models translate into meaningful differences in
empirical results.
